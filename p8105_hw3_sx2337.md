# Problem 2

I am given the five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25. The data is loaded and cleaned name here:

``` r
acc_data = read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

The data has week, day_id, day and 1440 activity with their respective
measured number. The data is too long to be read and therefore, I will
do the following procedure:

1.  privot long and create a column that store the activtity number and
    corresponding activity count.
2.  create a column specifying weekday or weekend.
3.  encode data with reasonable variable classes. Additionally, I factor
    the day variable so that day is leveled from Monday to Sunday in
    order.
4.  rearrange the order of columns and make week, day etc in the front
    and activity_minute and activity_count at the end.

``` r
acc_data_tidy = acc_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = 'activity_minute',
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = 'activity_count'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend = ifelse(day=='Saturday' | day=='Sunday', "weekend", "weekday")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id),
    day = factor(day,levels= c("Monday", 
    "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday","Sunday")),
    weekday_or_weekend = factor(weekday_or_weekend)
) %>% 
  select(week:day,weekday_or_weekend,everything())
acc_data_tidy
```

    ## # A tibble: 50,400 × 6
    ##    week day_id day    weekday_or_weekend activity_minute activity_count
    ##   <int>  <int> <fct>  <fct>              <chr>                    <dbl>
    ## 1     1      1 Friday weekday            1                         88.4
    ## 2     1      1 Friday weekday            2                         82.2
    ## 3     1      1 Friday weekday            3                         64.4
    ## 4     1      1 Friday weekday            4                         70.0
    ## 5     1      1 Friday weekday            5                         75.0
    ## # … with 50,395 more rows

The resulting data now has 6 variables, namely the week variable
specifying the week number, day_id variable specifying the id of the
day, day variable which measures the day is Monday to Sunday,
activity_minute variable measures for each minute of a 24-hour day
starting at midnight, activity_count measures the count of activity
during the one minute interval and weekday_or_weekend variable
specifying the day is weekday or weekend.

In the second part, I create a table that summarize the total activity
count of each day by following:

1.  using group_by to select the distint pairs of week and day variable
2.  summarize the sum respect to week and day
3.  create the table using pivot_wider

``` r
acc_data_tidy %>% 
  group_by(week,day) %>% 
  summarize(total_count = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total_count
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 8
    ## # Groups:   week [5]
    ##    week  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  Friday Saturday Sunday
    ##   <int>   <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1     1  78828. 307094.   340115.  355924. 480543.   376254 631105
    ## 2     2 295431  423245    440962   474048  568839    607175 422018
    ## 3     3 685910  381507    468869   371230  467420    382928 467052
    ## 4     4 409450  319568    434460   340291  154049      1440 260617
    ## 5     5 389080  367824    445366   549658  620860      1440 138421

There is no apparent obvious trend according to the table. It seems like
on last two weeks of Saturday, the old male does not do many activity
and activity count during weekdays are relatively stable.
